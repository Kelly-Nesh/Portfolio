          <p>Kelly Munene here, a software developer.</p>
          <p>
            Ever since I was little, I've been into computers. That early spark
            eventually blossomed into a love for coding late 2022. Now it's more
            than just a skill; it feels like I've discovered my true calling;
            like this is what I was meant to do!
          </p>
          <p>
            I love the energy of brainstorming with a team, but I also find
            focus and flow when coding solo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of code, faith, in God, plays a big role in my life.
            Honesty, trust, and patience are my guiding lights, both in coding
            and navigating the daily grind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stay tuned for a special "Meme Stash" section coming soon &dash;
            because let's face it, sometimes you need a side of laughter before
            you get back to finding the missing semicolon and unmatched
            parenthesisðŸ˜‚.
          </p>

          <p>
            Feel free to reach out if you have any project ideas or just wanna
            talk about coding (or memes!).
